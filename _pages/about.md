A.T.O.S. is a rewrite of the original bot [A.T.O.S by Wonderfall](https://github.com/Wonderfall/ATOS)! All the ideas and original design belong to him! It was rewritten from sratch by El Laggron for an integration with Red, more flexibility and the ability to work on multiple servers, without having to install the bot yourself.

The Tournaments module, code for the tournaments, was made by El Laggron with the amazing help from Xyleff, Wonderfall, and the Red-DiscordBot team!

A.T.O.S. is an instance of [Red, a modular open-source Discord bot](/what-is-red/), made by the [Cog-Creators](https://github.com/Cog-Creators) community, which I'm part of (Laggron).
