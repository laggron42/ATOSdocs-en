Once registrations and check-in are complete, the bot will automatically send participants to Challonge.

You can also start this process manually with `!upload`, a command that can be used multiple times without problems.

<div markdown="1" class="notice--danger">

<h4 class="no_toc">Attention</h4>

The bot will delete the previous list of participants on Challonge.

## Seeding avec [Braacket](https://braacket.com/)

You can configure a Braacket ranking with the command `!tset games ranking` for seeding.

For that, you need the ** name ** of the league, then the ** ID ** of its ranking, obtainable in the URL by exporting the ranking data.

### Comment trouver le nom et l'ID de sa league

For this example, I'll use the [ranking Braacket of Bronol's tournaments](https://braacket.com/league/C4370046-D937-4BCB-825D-10CE610198E6/).

1. First, go to your Bracket league page and click on "Ranking"

2. If you have several rankings, select the one that interests you

3. Once you're on your ranking page, everything is in the URL

4. Get the information you need *(and don't judge the pinned messages)*

   **Note :** The league name here is quite special, but it can also have a much more natural form (I think it's just customizable), so do not panic if your URL is supremely short.
   {: .notice--info}

5. Just have to use the command with our values : `!tset games ranking "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" C4370046-D937-4BCB-825D-10CE610198E6 A1F3809F-E117-45F9-A33E-1E05D9D8E864` (it is assumed here that the configured game is Smash bros.)

And that's it, everything is configured! Don't forget to reload with `!tfix reload` if your tournament is already setup

----

During the upload, the bot will then download the ranking data, then sort the participants according to their elo. The name on the ranking must be the same as the person's nickname on Discord.

When you use the `!upload` command with a configured ranking, the bot will display from which position the participants are no longer seeded (not found on the ranking), they are then mixed.

<div markdown="1" class="notice--info">

<h4 class="no_toc">Info</h4>

If no ranking is configured, the participants are in the same order as their registration

</div>

You are then free to adjust the seeding directly via Challonge, but be careful not to reuse `!upload` to avoid losing your order.

<div markdown="1" class="notice--warning">

<h4 class="no_toc">Info</h4>

You can manually add participants via Challonge, but this is risky !

- The names of these manually added participants must be ** exactly the same ** as the one on Discord, including the tag. If the bot cannot find a participant on the server, ** it will be automatically disqualified **.
- No role will be given to them
- They cannot be integrated into the seeding
- The bot only picks up these participants when the tournament starts, so you won't be able to make any adjustments.
