You have your beautiful Challonge tournament, it's time to configure it on the bot !

Use the command `!setup <lien du tournoi Challonge>` !

<div markdown="1" class="notice--success">

<h4 class="no_toc">Exemple</h4>

- `!setup https://challonge.com/p1wga3b7`

</div>

You can also use a link with additional information (if you are lazy like me), as long as the ID is visible (ex: `!setup https://challonge.com/p1wga3b7/settings`)
{: .notice--info}

----

The bot will show you a summary of the information, with the dates and times of all the events that need to take place.

If there are conflicts between some dates, the setup is canceled and the bot explains the problem to you. (ex: inscription dates outdates).

Check that all the information is correct, then validate with the reactions. The tournament is now configured !

You can, as long as the tournament is not started, reset this saved tournament with `!reset`.

----

From now on, the `!tinfo` command is available and will remain so until the end of the tournament.

This command displays various useful information depending on the current phase of the tournament (pending, registrations, check-in, tournament in progress).

If you have configured an automatic opening time for registrations, all you have to do is wait (the `!tinfo` command tells you the next incomming action and the time remaining).
