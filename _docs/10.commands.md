### Action commands

| Command | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `!win`  | The winner of a set settles his score with this command * (restricted to the score entry channel, if set) *. Example: `! Win 2-1`                                                       |
| `!ff`   | The participant of a set declares forfeit. This will set a score of -1 0 on the bracket. ** The participant isn't necessarily disqualified, he can go in loser bracket. **              |
| `!dq`   | The participant abandons the tournament and disqualifies himself. He is then the loser of all his future sets.                                                                          |
| `!lag`  | Thought for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and its high quality online, this command calls the T.O.s and asks for a lag test, to disqualify the laggy who doesn't have an ethernet adapter. |
| `!flip` | A simple coin toss command. Note that if a ban mode is configured, the bot chooses from the launch a participant to start the bans.                                                     |

<div markdown="1" class="notice--primary">

<h4 markdown="1" class="no_toc">Astuce</h4>

If you have no use for a command, just disable it with `!command disable`.

</div>

## Orders of T.O.s

Streamer controls are described here.

T.O.s can use `!rm` to disqualify members (using this same command before the tournament starts will simply unsubscribe).

<div markdown="1" class="notice--warning">

<h4 markdown="1" class="no_toc">Attention</h4>

While this can be tempting, ** don't try to order participants for them! **

Typically, doing `! Dq @Draver#4986` will not disqualify Draver, but you (if you are a participant)! For this specific case, use `!rm` instead.

Otherwise, as regards requalification of a participant or entry of scores, ** do this directly on the bracket! **

The bot manages change cases via Challonge, they are described in detail on the next page.
</div>

For the rest, here are some other commands available :

| Command         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `!lsmatches`    | List the matches in progress, sorted by duration. Useful for spotting sets slowing down the tournament.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `!setscore`     | Adjust the score of a set, giving the winner then the score (ex: `!setscore @Dracau 2-0`). The updated set is that of the channel in which you type the command. Otherwise, you can specify the set as the first argument (`!setscore 252 @Dracau 2-0`). |
| `!reset`        | Resets the configured tournament. ** Only works if the tournament is not started. ** The roles of registrants are removed.                                                                                                                               |
| `!resetbracket` | Bracket reset (big red Reset button on Challonge), result in ** the loss of all scores **. The tournament returns to its previous state (post registrations), registrants are kept, you can either restart with `!start` or start from 0 with`! Reset`.  |

The `!tfix` command is also available, but is described in [its own category](/troubleshooting/).
