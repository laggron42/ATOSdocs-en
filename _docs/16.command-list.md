| `!dq`       | The participant abandons the tournament and disqualifies himself. He is then the loser of all his future sets.                                                                                |

# Cleanup

A module to delete messages, more complete than you think ...

If you just want to delete a number of messages, just do `!clear x`, that's an alias by default. Otherwise, here are the details:

| Command             | Description                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |

| `!cleanup after`    | Delete all messages after the specified message           |
| `!cleanup before`   | Deletes a number of messages before the specified message |
| `!cleanup between`  | Delete all messages between two specified messages        |
| `!cleanup bot`      | Suppress command and bot messages                         |
| `!cleanup messages` | Simple deletion of messages (`!clear` is an alias)        |
| `!cleanup self`     | Suppress A..T.O.S messages.                               |
| `!cleanup spam`     | Removes duplicate messages, keeping only one copy         |
| `!cleanup text`     | Deletes messages containing the specified text            |
| `!cleanup user`     | Deletes messages containing the specified text            |

<div markdown="1" class="notice--info">

<h4 class="no_toc">Infos</h4>

- When you are asked to specify a message, you must obtain its ID (activate developer mode in the appearance options)
- Except for `!cleanup after` and `!cleanup between`, you must enter the number of messages to delete
- The bot will not delete pinned messages, unless you add `yes` at the end of your order
