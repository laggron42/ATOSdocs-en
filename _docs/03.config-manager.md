It is possible to have multiple configurations, so you can easily change settings depending on the game or ruleset you apply.

When you change the settings with `!tset`, you edit the **default** configuration. All tournaments will first use these settings. Suppose you have for example set all the parameters like this for your 1v1 Smash bros tournaments.

You can then create a new configuration, for example for Melee tournaments, and set a different ruleset channel, a list of different stages, as well as a separate player role. Using this configuration, the bot will first use these settings and then switch to the default configuration.

## Usage

### Create a configuration

You can manage your configurations with `!tset config`.

| Commande              | Description                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `!tset config add`    | Add a new config            |
| `!tset config remove` | Remove one of your configs  |
| `!tset config list`   | Display the list of configs |
| `!tset config rename` | Rename a config             |
| `!tset config clone`  | Clone an existing config    |

So, to create a configuration "2v2 Ultimate", you will do `!tset config add "2v2 Ultimate"`. *(Yes you have to use quotation marks if there are spaces)*

If the name of your configuration is the one of a game, then the bot will automatically use this configuration when you organize a tournament for that game.

Be careful though, the name of the game must be exactly the same as the one displayed on Challonge.

</div>

### Define the settings

To modify the parameters of this configuration, you must use a "flag" in your command, that is to say include the text `-c` or `--config` at the end of your command, followed by the name of your configuration.

<div markdown="1" class="notice--primary">

<h4 class="no_toc">Examples</h4>

- `!tset channels ruleset #melee-rules -c "Super Smash Bros. Melee"`
- `!tset delay 15m --config 2v2`
- `!tset register 3d 1h --config weekly`
- `!tset warntime 30m 5m10s -c "League of Legends"`

</div>

As you see you just need to add `-c "Name of the configuration"` somewhere at the end of your command.

Then, if you want to see the settings of your config, you just have to use the command `!tset settings` the same way.

<div markdown="1" class="notice--primary">

<h4 class="no_toc">Examples</h4>

- `!tset settings -c "Super Smash Bros. Melee"`
- `!tset settings --config 2v2`

</div>

### Use your configuration

As said before, a configuration whose name matches the name of the game will be used automatically if no other configuration is specified manually.

Otherwise, to specify a configuration, it's the same as with `!setup` quite simply, still with this "flag".

<div markdown="1" class="notice--primary">

<h4 class="no_toc">Examples</h4>

- `!setup https://challonge.com/fr/SSBM222 -c "Super Smash Bros. Melee"`
- `!setup https://challonge.com/fuzb1d3f/settings --config 2v2`

</div>
