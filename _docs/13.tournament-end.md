Once all matches are finished, the tournament will remain in progress until you use the `!end` command.

This command will purge messages from your configured channels (queue, scores, register, checkin), properly end the tournament on Challonge, send an announcement and remove the roles from participants.

So how did your tournament go?

Hope everything went well and you didn't have any issues!
