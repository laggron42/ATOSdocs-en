If you've installed this bot, it is probably for its advanced tournament management. I will explain the different steps to get you started.

## Challonge identifiers

First, configure your Challonge credentials. You must know your username as well as your API key, obtainable [here](https://challonge.com/settings/developer).

First type the command : `!challongeset username <your nickname>`, then `!challongeset api` (don't paste your key directly, the bot will ask you for it in DM).

<div markdown="1" class="notice--danger">

<h4 class="no_toc">Attention</h4>

You must keep your API key ** secret ** ! It gives access to your account and must be protected like your password.
</div>

## Globals configurations

After, the command `!tset` (or `!tournamentset`) allows you to configure all settings.

<div markdown="1" class="notice--info">

<h4 class="no_toc">Info</h4>

Most settings are optionals, unless specified. It's up to you to see what you consider useful or not among what the bot offers.

</div>

### Channel settings

Configure the different channels of your server with `!tset channels`.

| Command             | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `!tset channels to` | The private T.O.s channel, where the bot will announce any problems or requests for the tournament. |

Unlike the other channels which are optionals, you must set the T.O. channel
{: .notice--warning}

<h4 class="no_toc">Channels d'annonces</h4>

| Command                        | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `!tset channels announcements` | Channel announcements for the start of registrations, check-in, start and end of the tournament. |
| `!tset channels queue`         | the bot will announce the sets launched                                                                    |
| `!tset channels stream`        | The sets going on stream will be announced there.                                                          |
| `!tset channels ruleset`       | The rules channel for your tournament.                                                                     |

<h4 class="no_toc">Commands channels</h4>

| Commande                  | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `!tset channels register` | Registrations will take place there (people will use `!in` or`!out`).    |
| `!tset channels checkin`  | Check-in will take place there (people will use `!in`).                  |
| `!tset channels scores`   | The channel to set the score of his set with the command `!win`.         |

<div markdown="1" class="notice--primary">

If you configure one of its channels, the commands described can only be used in that channel.

The bot will unlock the channel and send a message to it at the appropriate time to explain how to use commands. It will then be automatically closed when necessary (eg: end of registrations).

</div>

### Roles configurations

Then, configure the different roles. You must give the full name of the role with the command, or its ID.

| Command                   | Description                                                                                                                              |

| `!tset roles player`      | This role will be mentioned when registration opens and will have permission to send messages to the registration channel. |
| `!tset roles streamer`    | The role that gives access to streamer controls.                                                                                         |

| `!tset roles to`          | The role of your T.O.s, giving access to related commands (except `!tset`).                                                              |

<div markdown="1" class="notice--warning">

** You don't need to configure a T.O. role if you have previously configured admin or modo roles with the `!set addadminrole / addmodrole` commands, which is recommended. **

Only use this setting if your T.O.s are not already moderating.

</div>

You can also configure a player role (limiting registrations to this role, while mentioning it for the opening of registrations) in a next step.
